# Deploy to Railway - Final Steps

Your Rick and Morty dating simulator is ready. The Railway-compatible server is working.

## Deploy Commands:
```bash
git add server/railway-minimal.cjs railway.json
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment server"
git push
```

## Then in Railway Dashboard:
1. Go to your service
2. Click "Deploy"
3. Wait for build to complete

## Your app will be live at:
https://rickmortyromance-production.up.railway.app

## Server includes:
- Health check endpoint (required by Railway)
- Character data API
- User settings API
- Conversation API
- Static file serving for your React app
- CommonJS format (no ES module issues)

The server binds to Railway's PORT environment variable and listens on 0.0.0.0 as required.
